The model code required for the Journal of Theoretical Biology paper or the Plant Pathology submission are available in the zipped folder.

The temperature data for the Plant Pathology paper is available in the Temperature_data folder.  The modelled climate data can be downloaded from https://data.ceda.ac.uk/badc/ukmo-hadobs/data/insitu/MOHC/HadOBS/HadUK-Grid/v1.0.1.0/1km and the R script Extract_temps_from_netcdf.R can be used to extract this data into a form usable by the DDE model.  These air temperatures can then be converted to modelled soil temperatures using the relationship given in Skelsey et al (2018) and described in the Plant Pathology paper.
